The solution involves adding a space between the selector and the pseudo-element. This clarifies the selector's intent for the CSS parser.

```css
.myElement ::before { /* Correct - space added */
  content: "Hello";
}
```

This ensures the `::before` pseudo-element is correctly targeted and styled.
