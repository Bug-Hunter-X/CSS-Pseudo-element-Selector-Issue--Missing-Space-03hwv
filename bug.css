The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element selector is not working as expected due to a missing space between the selector and the pseudo-element.  This can cause unexpected behavior or no styling at all.

```css
.myElement::before{ /* Incorrect - missing space */
  content: "Hello";
}
```
